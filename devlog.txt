This is a Next.js project for the PawApp landing page, initially created with v0.dev. The website is a single-page application that showcases the features of PawApp.

## Getting Started
1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install` in the root directory.
2.  **Run Development Server:** Run `pnpm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

## File Structure
-   `app/page.tsx`: The main and only page of the website. Contains the `PawappLanding` component.
-   `public/`: Contains static assets like images.
    -   `public/images/`: Contains all the images used on the website, including the hero carousel images and logos.
-   `components/ui/`: Contains UI components from `shadcn/ui`.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
-   `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
-   `app/globals.css`: Global styles.

## Key Components & Functionality
-   **`PawappLanding` Component (`app/page.tsx`)**: This is the main component that renders the entire landing page.
-   **Hero Section Carousel**:
    -   Located at the top of the `PawappLanding` component.
    -   Implemented using `embla-carousel-react` and `embla-carousel-autoplay`.
    -   The images for the carousel are located in `public/images` and are configured inside the `Carousel` component in `app/page.tsx`.
    -   The autoplay speed is configured in `app/page.tsx` within the `Autoplay` plugin options. The current delay is 4000ms (4 seconds).
    -   The carousel has a slanted edge created with `clip-path` and a smooth, feathered transition using `mask-image`.
-   **Clinic Cards**:
    -   The "Trusted Partner Clinics" section displays cards for different vet clinics.
    -   The images for these cards were initially missing and have been replaced with `/placeholder.svg`.
-   **Testimonials Section**:
    -   This section has been removed.
-   **Logo Watermarks**:
    -   Added large, faded, and rotated logo watermarks to the background of several sections for a creative and branded look.
