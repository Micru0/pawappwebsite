-   `app/blog/page.tsx`: A dedicated, SEO-optimized blog page with placeholder content.
-   `app/contact/page.tsx`: A dedicated, SEO-optimized contact page with a form and map.
-   `components/layout/header.tsx`: A reusable header component used across all pages.
-   `public/`: Contains static assets like images.
    -   `public/images/`: Contains all the images used on the website, including the hero carousel images and logos.
-   `components/ui/`: Contains UI components from `shadcn/ui`.

-   `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
-   `app/globals.css`: Global styles.

## Key Components & Functionality
-   **`Header` Component (`components/layout/header.tsx`)**: A reusable navigation component with a "glassmorphism" effect on scroll and a full-screen mobile menu.
-   **Hero Section (`app/page.tsx`)**:
    -   Fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile.
    -   Features a full-width image carousel on mobile.
-   **Blog & Contact Pages**:
    -   Separate, SEO-optimized pages for blog and contact information.
    -   Navigation links are fully functional and route to the correct pages.
-   **SEO & Metadata**:
    -   Added descriptive titles and meta descriptions to `app/layout.tsx`, `app/blog/layout.tsx`, and `app/contact/layout.tsx` to improve search engine visibility.
-   **App Download Links**:
    -   All "Download App" buttons now link to the official Apple App Store and Google Play Store pages.
-   **Navigation**:
    -   Smooth-scrolling anchor links for "Features," "Services," and "Clinics" sections on the main page.
-   **Footer**:
    -   A comprehensive footer has been added with quick links and contact information.
-   **`PawappLanding` Component (`app/page.tsx`)**: This is the main component that renders the entire landing page.
-   **Hero Section Carousel**:
    -   Located at the top of the `PawappLanding` component.
    -   Implemented using `embla-carousel-react` and `embla-carousel-autoplay`.
    -   The images for the carousel are located in `public/images` and are configured inside the `Carousel` component in `app/page.tsx`.
    -   The autoplay speed is configured in `app/page.tsx` within the `Autoplay` plugin options. The current delay is 4000ms (4 seconds).
    -   The carousel has a slanted edge created with `clip-path` and a smooth, feathered transition using `mask-image`.
-   **Clinic Cards**:
    -   The "Trusted Partner Clinics" section displays cards for different vet clinics.
    -   The images for these cards were initially missing and have been replaced with `/placeholder.svg`.
-   **Testimonials Section**:
    -   This section has been removed.
-   **Logo Watermarks**:
    -   Added large, faded, and rotated logo watermarks to the background of several sections for a creative and branded look.
-   **Responsive Hero Carousel**:
    -   Capped the slide height on mobile to `max-h-[70vh]` to prevent the illustration from dominating the screen.
    -   Added safe-area padding (`pt-[env(safe-area-inset-top)]`) and horizontal padding (`px-4 sm:px-6`) to the hero container to avoid content hugging the edges or notch.
    -   Elevated the navbar to a fixed layer with `z-20` and applied a subtle backdrop blur, so the menu icon sits clearly above the carousel.
    -   Implemented fluid typography for the headline (`h1`) and subtitle (`p.subtitle`) using CSS `clamp()` for better readability across different screen sizes.
    -   Adjusted text alignment to be centered on small screens and left-aligned from the `md` breakpoint and up.
    -   Applied `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: 50% 20%` to the carousel images to keep key visual elements in frame.
    -   Optimized image loading by flagging the first slide with `priority` and lazy-loading the rest.
    -   Created a "fade-into-navy" effect with a `linear-gradient` overlay that blends the top of the carousel into the navbar.
    -   Added tiny yellow dot indicators below the hero section on mobile (`lg:hidden`) to provide visual feedback for the carousel.
    -   Implemented support for the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, which disables auto-sliding while still allowing swipe gestures.
    -   Adjusted the primary CTA button to be anchored below the subtitle on small viewports and added a subtle shadow for better depth.

## Recent Changes
-   **Branch Cleanup**: Removed the unused `feat/i18n-kuwaiti-arabic` and `cursor/begin-sub-website-seo-development-c388` branches to organize the repository.
-   **Official Download Buttons**: Added the official Apple App Store and Google Play badges (`ApplestoreEN.svg` and `GooglestoreEN.png`) to the project and updated all download links in `app/page.tsx` to use these new images.
-   Replaced the default App Store and Google Play buttons with official badges (`AppleEN.svg` and `GoogleEN.png`) in the hero, app preview, and CTA sections for a more authentic and trustworthy appearance.
-   **SEO and Social Sharing**: Added a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers and implemented Open Graph meta tags for improved social media link sharing and SEO.
-   **Hero Section Enhancement**: Updated the hero section with a new background image (`pawapp-background.png`), a more engaging headline, and a prominent call-to-action to improve user engagement.
-   **Global Background**:
    -   Implemented a fixed, transparent PawApp logo as a global background watermark.
    -   Used a CSS pseudo-element (`::before`) on the `body` to create a distinct background layer, ensuring content remains fully opaque.
    -   Removed redundant, section-specific watermarks and background colors to create a unified, branded experience.
-   **Download Buttons**:
    -   Replaced the default App Store and Google Play buttons with official badges (`AppleEN.svg` and `GoogleEN.png`) in the hero, app preview, and CTA sections for a more authentic and trustworthy appearance.
    -   Ensured the new images are properly linked to the respective app store URLs.
    -   Adjusted the image dimensions to maintain a consistent and visually appealing layout across all sections.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    -   A previous attempt to implement Kuwaiti Arabic i18n (`feat/i18n-kuwaiti-arabic`) resulted in a broken build and was reverted. This implementation is considered unstable and should not be revisited.
    -   The current version of the application is stable without Kuwaiti Arabic localization.
-   **Navigation & CTA Update**:
    -   The "Download" button in the top navigation bar now smoothly scrolls to the "Download CTA" section at the bottom of the page.
    -   The "Download CTA" section has been updated to display the "Download PawApp" title more prominently, with the app store badges appearing directly below it.
    -   The descriptive text in the CTA section is now positioned under the download badges for a more logical and visually appealing flow.
