## Getting Started
1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install` in the root directory.
2.  **Run Development Server:** Run `pnpm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

## File Structure
-   `app/page.tsx`: The main landing page.
-   `app/blog/page.tsx`: A dedicated, SEO-optimized blog page with placeholder content.
-   `app/contact/page.tsx`: A dedicated, SEO-optimized contact page with a form and map.
-   `components/layout/header.tsx`: A reusable header component used across all pages.
-   `public/`: Contains static assets like images.
    -   `public/images/`: Contains all the images used on the website, including the hero carousel images and logos.
-   `components/ui/`: Contains UI components from `shadcn/ui`.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
-   `tailwind.config.ts`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
-   `app/globals.css`: Global styles.

## Key Components & Functionality
-   **`Header` Component (`components/layout/header.tsx`)**: A reusable navigation component with a "glassmorphism" effect on scroll and a full-screen mobile menu.
-   **Hero Section (`app/page.tsx`)**:
    -   Fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile.
    -   Features a full-width image carousel on mobile.
-   **Blog & Contact Pages**:
    -   Separate, SEO-optimized pages for blog and contact information.
    -   Navigation links are fully functional and route to the correct pages.
-   **SEO & Metadata**:
    -   Added descriptive titles and meta descriptions to `app/layout.tsx`, `app/blog/layout.tsx`, and `app/contact/layout.tsx` to improve search engine visibility.
-   **App Download Links**:
    -   All "Download App" buttons now link to the official Apple App Store and Google Play Store pages.
-   **Navigation**:
    -   Smooth-scrolling anchor links for "Features," "Services," and "Clinics" sections on the main page.
-   **Footer**:
    -   A comprehensive footer has been added with quick links and contact information.
-   **`PawappLanding` Component (`app/page.tsx`)**: This is the main component that renders the entire landing page.
-   **Hero Section Carousel**:
    -   Located at the top of the `PawappLanding` component.
    -   Implemented using `embla-carousel-react` and `embla-carousel-autoplay`.
    -   The images for the carousel are located in `public/images` and are configured inside the `Carousel` component in `app/page.tsx`.
    -   The autoplay speed is configured in `app/page.tsx` within the `Autoplay` plugin options. The current delay is 4000ms (4 seconds).
    -   The carousel has a slanted edge created with `clip-path` and a smooth, feathered transition using `mask-image`.
-   **Clinic Cards**:
    -   The "Trusted Partner Clinics" section displays cards for different vet clinics.
    -   The images for these cards were initially missing and have been replaced with `/placeholder.svg`.
-   **Testimonials Section**:
    -   This section has been removed.
-   **Logo Watermarks**:
    -   Added large, faded, and rotated logo watermarks to the background of several sections for a creative and branded look.
-   **Responsive Hero Carousel**:
    -   Capped the slide height on mobile to `max-h-[70vh]` to prevent the illustration from dominating the screen.
    -   Added safe-area padding (`pt-[env(safe-area-inset-top)]`) and horizontal padding (`px-4 sm:px-6`) to the hero container to avoid content hugging the edges or notch.
    -   Elevated the navbar to a fixed layer with `z-20` and applied a subtle backdrop blur, so the menu icon sits clearly above the carousel.
    -   Implemented fluid typography for the headline (`h1`) and subtitle (`p.subtitle`) using CSS `clamp()` for better readability across different screen sizes.
    -   Adjusted text alignment to be centered on small screens and left-aligned from the `md` breakpoint and up.
    -   Applied `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: 50% 20%` to the carousel images to keep key visual elements in frame.
    -   Optimized image loading by flagging the first slide with `priority` and lazy-loading the rest.
    -   Created a "fade-into-navy" effect with a `linear-gradient` overlay that blends the top of the carousel into the navbar.
    -   Added tiny yellow dot indicators below the hero section on mobile (`lg:hidden`) to provide visual feedback for the carousel.
    -   Implemented support for the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, which disables auto-sliding while still allowing swipe gestures.
    -   Adjusted the primary CTA button to be anchored below the subtitle on small viewports and added a subtle shadow for better depth.

## Dependencies
-   **Framework**: Next.js
-   **Package Manager**: pnpm
-   **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
-   **Carousel**: embla-carousel-react, embla-carousel-autoplay
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Recent Changes
-   **Branch Cleanup**: Removed the unused `feat/i18n-kuwaiti-arabic` and `cursor/begin-sub-website-seo-development-c388` branches to organize the repository.
-   **Official Download Buttons**: Added the official Apple App Store and Google Play badges (`ApplestoreEN.svg` and `GooglestoreEN.png`) to the project and updated all download links in `app/page.tsx` to use these new images.
-   Replaced the default App Store and Google Play buttons with official badges (`AppleEN.svg` and `GoogleEN.png`) in the hero, app preview, and CTA sections for a more authentic and trustworthy appearance.
-   **SEO and Social Sharing**: Added a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers and implemented Open Graph meta tags for improved social media link sharing and SEO.
-   **Hero Section Enhancement**: Updated the hero section with a new background image (`pawapp-background.png`), a more engaging headline, and a prominent call-to-action to improve user engagement.
-   **Global Background**:
    -   Implemented a fixed, transparent PawApp logo as a global background watermark.
    -   Used a CSS pseudo-element (`::before`) on the `body` to create a distinct background layer, ensuring content remains fully opaque.
    -   Removed redundant, section-specific watermarks and background colors to create a unified, branded experience.
-   **Download Buttons**:
    -   Replaced the default App Store and Google Play buttons with official badges (`AppleEN.svg` and `GoogleEN.png`) in the hero, app preview, and CTA sections for a more authentic and trustworthy appearance.
    -   Ensured the new images are properly linked to the respective app store URLs.
    -   Adjusted the image dimensions to maintain a consistent and visually appealing layout across all sections.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    -   A previous attempt to implement Kuwaiti Arabic i18n (`feat/i18n-kuwaiti-arabic`) resulted in a broken build and was reverted. This implementation is considered unstable and should not be revisited without careful planning.
    -   The current version of the application is stable without Kuwaiti Arabic localization.
-   **Navigation & CTA Update**:
    -   The "Download" button in the top navigation bar now smoothly scrolls to the "Download CTA" section at the bottom of the page.
    -   The "Download CTA" section has been updated to display the "Download PawApp" title more prominently, with the app store badges appearing directly below it.
    -   The descriptive text in the CTA section is now positioned under the download badges for a more logical and visually appealing flow.

**Clinic Cards Carousel**:
    -   The "Trusted Partner Clinics" section has been updated to use a carousel slider.
    -   The carousel is implemented using `embla-carousel-react` and includes next/previous buttons for navigation.
    -   The images for the clinics are located in `public/images/vets/`.
-   **Dynamic Blog Implementation**:
    -   Implemented a fully dynamic, SEO-optimized blog powered by local markdown files.
    -   Added `gray-matter` and `remark` to parse markdown frontmatter and content.
    -   Created a new `posts` directory to store blog articles.
    -   Developed a `lib/posts.ts` utility module to handle reading and processing of blog posts.
    -   Built a dynamic route `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to render individual posts with unique metadata and JSON-LD schema.
    -   Refactored the main blog page (`app/blog/page.tsx`) and the landing page's blog preview section to dynamically display posts.

-   **Main Page Refactoring (Server/Client Components)**:
    -   Resolved a build error (`Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'`) by refactoring the main page (`app/page.tsx`) to correctly separate server and client logic.
    -   `app/page.tsx` was converted into a Server Component, responsible for fetching blog post data on the server.
    -   The interactive UI of the main page was moved to a new Client Component, `components/layout/landing-page.tsx`.
    -   This change aligns with Next.js best practices, preventing server-side modules from being incorrectly bundled in client-side code.

-   **Blog Section Overhaul (UI & Bug Fixes)**:
    -   **Markdown Rendering**: Fixed a critical bug where markdown content, especially tables, was not rendering correctly. This was resolved by installing and configuring `remark-gfm` in `lib/posts.ts` and `@tailwindcss/typography` in `tailwind.config.ts`.
    -   **Next.js Parameter Error**: Resolved a persistent error (`Route "/blog/[slug]" used \`params.slug\`. \`params\` should be awaited before using its properties.`) in Next.js 15. This was a subtle issue related to the "lazy" loading of route parameters in asynchronous Server Components. The definitive fix was to `await` the `slug` before passing it to the data fetching function, like so: `const slug = await params.slug; const postData = await getPostData(slug);`. This was implemented in `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` for both the `generateMetadata` and `Post` functions.
    -   **UI Enhancements**:
        -   Redesigned the blog post page (`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`) with a modern, card-like layout, featuring a blurred background and rounded corners.
        -   Added a prominent "Go Back" link for improved navigation.
        -   The post title is now styled with a gradient text effect to make it stand out.
        -   Added the publication date below the title for better context.
        -   Custom styles were added to the `article` container to improve the presentation of tables within the markdown content.

## Codebase Deep Dive & Optimization

### Project Structure & Core Files
-   **`app/page.tsx`**: The main entry point and primary component for the landing page. All sections of the page are rendered from this file.
-   **`app/blog/page.tsx` & `app/contact/page.tsx`**: Separate, SEO-optimized pages for the blog and contact form.
-   **`components/layout/header.tsx`**: The reusable header component used across all pages.
-   **`app/globals.css`**: The single source of truth for global styles. It contains the base Tailwind CSS configuration, theme variables (CSS variables for colors, spacing, etc.), and the global background watermark style.
-   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS. The `content` array has been optimized to only scan the `app` and `components` directories for better performance.

### Asset Usage
-   **`public/images/`**: This directory contains all the active images used on the website.
    -   `paw-app-logo.png`: Used in the header, footer, and as a global background watermark in `app/globals.css`. **Note: This is a large file (2MB) and should be compressed.**
    -   `pawapp-background.png`, `pawappdog.png`, `pawappcat.png`, `pawappbros.png`: Used in the hero section carousel. **Note: These are large files (>1MB) and should be compressed.**
    -   `pawapp-iphone-screenshot.png`: Used in the app preview section.
    -   `ApplestoreEN.svg` & `GooglestoreEN.png`: Used for the app download buttons.
-   **`public/images/vets/`**: This directory contains all the images for the vet clinics.
    -   `paw-app-logo.png`: Used in the header, footer, and as a global background watermark in `app/globals.css`. **Note: This is a large file (2MB) and should be compressed.**
    -   `pawapp-background.png`, `pawappdog.png`, `pawappcat.png`, `pawappbros.png`: Used in the hero section carousel. **Note: These are large files (>1MB) and should be compressed.**
    -   `pawapp-iphone-screenshot.png`: Used in the app preview section.
    -   `ApplestoreEN.svg` & `GooglestoreEN.png`: Used for the app download buttons.
-   **`public/placeholder.svg`**: This is used for the blog post preview images.
-   **Icons**: All icons used in the application are from the `lucide-react` library and are not individual image files.

### Dependencies & Configuration
-   **`package.json`**: All dependencies have been verified and are actively used by the project. No packages were removed during the cleanup.
-   **`.gitignore`**: The file has been updated to ignore `.DS_Store` files, which keeps the repository clean from macOS-specific system files.
-   **`next.config.mjs`**: The configuration is set to use `swcMinify: true`, which enables the Speedy Web Compiler for faster JavaScript minification.

### Recent Cleanup Actions
-   **Removed Files**: The following unused files and directories were deleted to reduce project clutter:
    -   `public/placeholder-logo.png`
    -   `public/placeholder-user.jpg`
    -   `public/placeholder.jpg`
    -   `public/placeholder-logo.svg`
    -   `pawapp-landing.tsx` (old, Vercel-generated component)
    -   `hooks/` (redundant directory)
    -   `styles/` (redundant directory)
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: A previous attempt to implement Kuwaiti Arabic i18n (`feat/i18n-kuwaiti-arabic`) resulted in a broken build and was reverted. This implementation is considered unstable and should not be revisited without careful planning.

## Development Session Summary (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)

This session focused on a comprehensive cleanup, optimization, and redesign of the PawApp landing page. The following key activities were performed:

-   **Project Cleanup**: Conducted a thorough analysis of the codebase to identify and remove unused assets and components.
    -   Deleted obsolete placeholder images (`placeholder-logo.png`, `placeholder-user.jpg`, `placeholder.jpg`, `placeholder-logo.svg`).
    -   Removed the outdated `pawapp-landing.tsx` component.
    -   Eliminated redundant `hooks/` and `styles/` directories.
    -   Updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude `.DS_Store` files.

-   **Performance Optimization**: Implemented several changes to improve the website's loading speed and build times.
    -   Optimized the `tailwind.config.ts` file to only scan relevant directories.
    -   Verified all dependencies in `package.json` to ensure no unused packages were included.
    -   **Actionable Recommendation**: The images in `public/images`, particularly the large PNG files, should be compressed to significantly improve performance.

-   **Component Redesign: Trusted Partner Clinics**: The "Trusted Partner Clinics" section was completely overhauled to improve its design and user experience.
    -   Replaced the static grid with a dynamic, responsive carousel using `embla-carousel-react`.
    -   Redesigned the clinic cards with a modern, actionable layout featuring a logo, working hours, and "Location" and "Call" buttons.
    -   Applied a "glassmorphism" effect to the cards, with a dark, blurred background and yellow accent borders, to create a cohesive look with the rest of the site.
    -   Iteratively refined the card design to improve alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## Documentation Additions

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js App Router (15.x), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Rendering split**:
  - `app/page.tsx` is a Server Component fetching blog data via `getSortedPostsData()`.
  - Interactive UI lives in `components/layout/landing-page.tsx` (Client Component).
- **Layouts**:
  - Global: `app/layout.tsx` for global styles and metadata.
  - Section layouts: `app/blog/layout.tsx`, `app/contact/layout.tsx`.
- **Shared UI**:
  - Reusable `Header` and `Footer` components in `components/layout/`.
  - Shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/`.

### Content Authoring (Blog)
- **Location**: `posts/*.md`
- **Frontmatter schema**:
  - `title` (string, required)
  - `date` (ISO date string, required)
  - `description` (string, required)
  - `author` (string, optional)
  - `coverImage` (string, optional; local URL like `/images/blog/xxx.png` recommended)
  - `schema` (object, required; JSON-LD)
- **Pipeline**: Parsed with `gray-matter`, rendered with `remark` + `remark-gfm` to HTML, styled via `@tailwindcss/typography`.
- **Routes**:
  - Index: `app/blog/page.tsx` (uses `BlogIndex` component)
  - Post: `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (awaits `params.slug` per Next 15 lazy params)
