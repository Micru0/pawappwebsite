### TL;DR featured snippet

Hydrate, shade, and limit walks to pre-sunrise or post-sunset. Cooling mats, damp towels on paws/belly, and never leaving pets in cars are Kuwait vets’ top 2025 heat-safety tips.

### 1. Know the Danger Zone
- Asphalt hits 70 °C at 2 pm when air temp is 50 °C—enough to burn paws in <60 sec.

### 2. Vet-Approved Cooling Hacks

| Tip | Why it works |
|---|---|
| Freeze low-sodium broth into “pupsicles.” | Increases fluid intake. |
| Cooling mat or damp towel under belly. | Promotes conductive heat loss. |
| Light coat trim—never full shave for double-coated breeds (risk of sunburn). | |

### 3. Heatstroke Red Flags
- Heavy panting, glazed eyes, vomiting, rectal temp > 40 °C.
- Emergency protocol: move to AC, wet paws, call vet via PawApp.

### 4. Summer-Safe Exercise Schedule
- Suggested walk times: 04:30–06:00 AM & 7:00–11:00 PM.
- Indoor games: snuffle mats, treat puzzles.
