### TL;DR featured snippet

Pets entering Kuwait in 2025 must be micro-chipped, at least 4 months old, fully vaccinated (rabies ≥30 days & ≤12 months), and arrive with a PAAFR import permit plus a vet-issued health certificate issued within 10 days of travel.

### 1. Age, Microchip & Vaccines
- Minimum age: 4 months for cats or dogs.
- ISO 11784/11785 microchip required.
- Rabies vaccine window: 30 days – 1 year before arrival.

### 2. Import Permit (PAAFR)
1. Apply online or via a Kuwait-based sponsor 30-45 days before travel.
2. Permit valid for 30 days once issued.

### 3. Health Certificate
- Endorsed by a government vet in the exporting country.
- Must list microchip ID, vaccines, parasite treatments, and destination address.

### 4. Quarantine & Airport Process
- No mandatory quarantine if paperwork is clean, but dogs often stay one night in the cargo facility for inspection.
- Expect KD 20–40 handling fees.

### 5. Airline & Summer Heat Restrictions
- Airlines may embargo pets when temps > 37 °C; plan late-night or early-morning arrivals.
- PawApp Tip: Book a vet visit in-app the week after arrival for de-stress and local registration.
